# Advanced Goals
- [x] Simple points. 
- [x] Gravity. (Sparks Emitter from Spaceship Exhaust and Rain Particle System)
- [x] Shapes and multiple emitters. (Spaceship Exhaust is composed of five different emitters)
- [x] Multiple particle systems. (Rain and Spaceship Exhaust)
- [ ] Add a repellor/attractor. 
- [ ] Add trails. 
- [ ] Create a compelling explosion effect. 
- [x] Create a compelling spaceship exhaust effect. 
- [x] Create a rain or snow effect.
- [ ] Create a dissolve effect. 
- [ ] Create a smoke effect using a fluid simulation.
